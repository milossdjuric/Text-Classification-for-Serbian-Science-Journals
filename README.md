# Text-Classification-for-Serbian-Science-Journals

**Project problem**
- The goal of the project is to use different text classification algorithms to classify text paragraphs from Serbian scientific journals into different categories.
- The categories can be as follows:
  - Architecture and Civil Engineering
  - Biology
  - Economy
  - Geoscience
  - Chemistry
  - Informatics and Electrical Engineering
  - Mathematics
  - Medicine
  - Agriculture

**Algorithms** 
- Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN

**Data**
- Data from the website: https://scindeks.ceon.rs/

**Performance measurement metric**
- Performance is measured using accuracy and macro average metrics.

**Solution validation**
- The dataset is divided into 70% for the training set, 15% for the validation set, and 15% for the test set.


**Library Installation**
- Additional python library called SrbAi is necessary to run the code. It can be downloaded from their GitHub repository: https://github.com/Serbian-AI-Society/SrbAI, and installed following their instructions from repository.
